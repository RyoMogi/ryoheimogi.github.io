I now survived two years as a postdoc researcher in two different places outside of my home country. I think I can say that I did it, right? But still, I have been and am struggling to construct my academic career.

There are three ways to get a postdoc position after your secured PhD period: 1) get a fellowship, 2) get a position opened by a research institute or university, 3) join in a research project. The option 2 and 3 are unpredictable, because you never know when, how many, and where the call is open by who. So, only thing that we can prepare for and plan by ourselves is to apply a fellowship.

That is why I made a list of postdoc fellowships for myself, and would like to share it to all postdoc survivors. [This list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/144g4XX7YwKmJt2MAiu3LDlvUq1Byk6sKK5VQkUkRvFM/edit?usp=sharing) contains 38 fellowships (for early career researchers) in Europe, North America, and Australia.

Feel free to share this list to your colleagues and friends. Apply Apply Apply! Let's survive together and get a permanent position one day.
