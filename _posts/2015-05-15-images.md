I have been looking for a colour palette that looks great both in a colour version and a black and white version. Nowadays, most journals accept articles to have figures with colours, but still not so much for the printed version.

I used to use the palette from this website: a colour-blind and print-friendly. It worked very well when I used it for three colours. But I realised that more than five colours from this palette do not work so well in black and white. So, I started creating a palette myself and after spending "some" hours, I finally got a satisfied my version of the colour palette.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/colourpalette.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    In colour
</div>

HEX format: `#08306B`, "#238B45", "#FD8D3C", "#D4B9DA", "#FFEDA0"

Please feel free to use it if you like!

I got this idea from Vladimir Canudas-Romo and also received several suggestions from my friends, Ilya ([@ikashnitsky](https://twitter.com/ikashnitsky?s=20&t=YnCNCmVPKK48IGjQG43cmA)) and Tim([@timriffe1](https://twitter.com/timriffe1?s=20&t=YnCNCmVPKK48IGjQG43cmA)). Thanks!!
