##### **Aim**

This project aims to understand family demographic changes in Japan. Whilst many features of the Second Demographic Transition (SDT) is clearly visible in Japan (e.g., declining marriage, increasing divorce, declining fertility), Japan has distinctive trends from the general pattern of the SDT. Thus, I describe and analyse changes in family demographic behaviours in Japan compared to other high-income countries.
