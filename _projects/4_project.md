Aim
---
This project aims to analyse romantic relationship (having a partner or not) as an initial event of the transition to further family events, such as cohabitation, marriage and childbearing. So far, I have focused on Italy, Japan, and Spain, but would like to explore other countries, South Korea, Nordic countries, etc. If you are interested in and have data access, please contact me!
