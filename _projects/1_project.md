##### **Aim**

This project aims to bring an alternative perspective to the study of family demography by measuring the *duration* of union and fertility events. I developed several new indicators for a better understanding of current family dynamics. I have focused on mainly high-income countries, but the methods can be applied to other groups of countries.
