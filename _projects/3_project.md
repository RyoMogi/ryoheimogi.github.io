##### **Aim**

This project aims to understand 1) the impact of political changes on population behaviours and 2) the impact of population changes on political behaviours. The first one has been paid significant attention and thus has plenty of previous research, such as how parental leave associates couple's relationship/further fertility, whilst the latter one has received less attention so far in the field.
